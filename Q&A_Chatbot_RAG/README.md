# Q&A Chatbot with RAG for business Requirements

# Business Setup Question Answering (QA) Bot

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model for a **Question Answering (QA)** bot. The QA bot is designed to answer questions related to setting up a business based on the document titled *Set Up Business*. It uses a vector database to store document embeddings and a generative model to generate coherent and informative answers.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload business-related documents (PDFs) and ask questions based on the content.
- **Real-time Question Answering**: The bot retrieves relevant information from the document and generates answers to user queries.
- **Interactive UI**: The application is built with **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface for document uploads and query inputs.
- **Chat History**: The system maintains the chat history of interactions, providing a seamless experience for the user.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Vector Database**: Pinecone (or any other vector database) for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
- **Generative Model**: Cohere API (or any other LLM) for generating responses based on retrieved context.
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive frontend interface.
- **LangChain**: For managing the question-answering chain and retrieval process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A virtual environment (recommended)
- API access to a large language model (Cohere/OpenAI API, etc.)
- Pinecone API access (for document embeddings)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/business-qa-bot.git
   cd business-qa-bot
